# NetworkPerformanceSim
The Network Simulation project is a Java-based application designed to simulate the behavior of a network of stations sending packets to a server. The simulation models packet arrival, transmission, and delivery times, while also tracking key metrics such as packet loss, average delay, and network throughput.
